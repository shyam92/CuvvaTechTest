#  Cuvva Code Test

Use Cocoapods to install Realm depandancies. 

I used Realm is quicker to carry out queries to the database as well as its quicker to setup up too. Creating objects are independant of saving in to Realm and it has a single source of truth that it is there aren't different contexts that have different data.

### Assumptions that I made.
 - Policy can multiple child/extension policies .
 - Transactions can be associated with any policy.
 - Cancelled/Void Policies can be added to extension policies.


### Things that I would've improved on
 - Having a text heirarchy file so that all text can be associated to that master text heirarchy file
 - Having a color pallette stylesheet so that all types of shading and colors can be combined. As some colors need to have a white bg to show properly and match designs.
